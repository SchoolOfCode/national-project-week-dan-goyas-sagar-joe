# DISNEY IDEATION PHASE

## Dreamer

- Access to school of code resources(the video's), articles they have put in ect
- Input box where you can search - concepps and keywords for topics we've learned - includes youtube vids, articles, common mistakes ect, correct syntaxt ect
  -- could have an api with data for each React concepts

- ## Do to list of things we've covered on a date, reflection on each day, calender

- Simple and looks good, bootcampers focus
- leave comments - on each resource of a concept you have searched
- coding example and challenge after looking at the resources - test and recap.
  -- git hub link with code where they do some tasks to cemend the concept of what they've searched

- Time saving - not having to go over the lectures of the day just to find one bit
- Concice resouyrces that relates to what bootcampers have learend that day eg in the correct syntax
- just a place that has resources that you know are school of code 'approved' (correct syntax ect)

{id: "", conceptName: "", articles: "", video: }

## Realist

- Coach reccomendations, what helped us, coach expertise - which coach is best for this concept
- MPV - React concepts to start with - very hard topic for everyone so we want to focus on this for MVP
  -- concepps and keywords for topics we've learned - includes youtube vids, articles, common mistakes ect, correct syntaxt ect
- Depending on time - add a reflection on each concept/component
  -- 2 ratings, how you feel before and after looking at this resource
  -- Date added of when you looked at the resource

- Coding example in general could be a stretch, depending on time we can think of practice code
  -- Speak to chris or Liz about having a github link that makea a repository in their name to practice
  -- in the object could have acoding example of the correct syntax and an example
